# Web-Development-Archive
My Web Development Archive (2018-2021) which includes my projects, or what is left of it anyways.

Do note that most of the code will probably be broken or depreciated. 

I also have removed all of the node_module folders containing all of the NodeJS modules from npm, 
it could always be installed again with npm
